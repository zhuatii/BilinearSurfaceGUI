# Bilinear Surface Display

Run the file [BilinearSurfaceProject_1.py](BilinearSurfaceProject_1.py).

-The program can read data from a file and display the bilinear surface and their
Gaussian and Mean curvature.
-The GUI has the provision to display 2 different surfaces.
-Surface 1 is a patch of hyperbolic paraboloid, and Surface 2 is a random bilinear surface.
-Toggle the radio button to display the surface.
-Click on the push button to display the Gaussian curvature or the mean curvature of the surface selected by toggling the radio button.

The navigation toolbar for both displays is at the top. The first is for the surface plot, and the second is for the curvature plot. They can be docked at anyposition. Click on the right-pointing triangle to display more options.

The text box below the curvature plot says which plot is currently displayed.


For further improvement, The code can be made to run on user input and let it not
be limited only to bilinear surface.
