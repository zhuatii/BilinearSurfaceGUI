Bilinear Surface Display

Run the file BilinearSurfaceProject_1.py

The program can read data from a file and display the bilinear surface and their
Gaussian and Mean curvature.
The GUI has the provision to display 2 different surfaces.
Surface 1 is a patch of hyperbolic paraboloid, Surface 2 is a random bilinear surface.
Toggle the radio button to display the surface.
Click on the push button to display the Gaussian curvature or the mean curvature of 
the surface that is selected by toggling the radio button.

The navigation tool bar for both the displays are at the top. First one is for the 
surface plot and the second one for the curvature plot. They can be docked at any
position. Click on the right pointing triangle to display more options.

The text box below the curvature plot says which plot is currently displayed.


For further improvement, The code can be made to run on user input and let it not
be limited only to bilinear surface.
